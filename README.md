# Front_end_Uni
Front end Project made for a web development university course
The website is made of 5 pages, first page is the home page which shows the importance of art, then we have 3 pages one about painting, one music and one sculpture, each of them talk about their art
and show some of the world most famous works with 2 paragraphs in a slider, the first is about the work itself and the second talks about the artist, and the last page is just a simple javascript page which allows you to upload an image with its title and owner, and show it on the page.
